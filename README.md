# Redwood.js Backend API for Univ Sessions

## Overview

This backend API is built using Redwood.js and GraphQL, providing a flexible foundation for managing student and dean sessions. The system supports multiple types of users, specifically Students and Deans, with distinct permissions for session visibility and booking.

- Students can only view free Dean sessions.
- Deans have the authority to view both free and pending sessions.

Authentication is required for accessing session listings and making bookings. A mutation for login is available to retrieve the bearer token for authenticated requests.

1. Run prisma studio
    ```bash
    yarn rw prisma studio
    ```

## Authentication

For authentication, use the provided mutation for login to retrieve the bearer token. This token is required for accessing protected endpoints.

```graphql
mutation Login($email: String!, $password: String!) {
  login(email: $email, password: $password) {
    token
  }
}
```

## GraphQL Types
To use the generated graphql types, please follow these steps:
1. Generate the types
    ```bash
    yarn rw g types
    ```
2. Import the types from `types/graphql`
    ```ts
    import type { MutationResolvers, QueryResolvers } from 'types/graphql'

    export const availableSessions: QueryResolvers['availableSessions'] = () => {}
    ```
